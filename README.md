# Algorithm-Insert-one-
Inserts a '1' in middle of the longest sequence of '0's in a given number

## Problem ##
Task is to write a function that takes a binary string and inserts a '1' in the middle of the longest sequence of '0's. It only does so at the first instance of such (e.g. 1000010000101 has 2 sets of 4 '0's and becomes 10010010000101). Also if the longest sequence of '0's has an odd number of '0's, we add the '1' to the right of the central '0' (e.g. 100000101 becomes 1001000101).
